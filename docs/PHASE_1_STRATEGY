# PHASE 1 STRATEGY - Technical Decisions & Implementation Plan

## Project Scope Decisions

### Data Sources & APIs

**1. Market Data API - DECIDED: Yahoo Finance**
- **Decision**: Use Yahoo Finance via the `yfinance` Python library
- **Rationale**: Well-established, free, reliable, and widely used in the community
- **Implementation**: `pip install yfinance`
- **Reference**: [yfinance documentation](https://ranaroussi.github.io/yfinance/)

**2. News Data API - RESEARCH REQUIRED**
Based on web research, top options for financial news APIs include:

**Alpha Vantage** (Recommended)
- **Pros**: 
  - Offers both market data AND news/sentiment APIs
  - NASDAQ-licensed provider
  - Includes sentiment analysis built-in
  - Free tier available (500 requests/day)
- **Cons**: Rate limits on free tier
- **Reference**: [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/)

**Alternative Options to Consider**:
- NewsAPI (general news, limited financial focus)
- Financial Modeling Prep (comprehensive financial data)
- Polygon.io (real-time market data with news)

**RECOMMENDATION**: Start with Alpha Vantage since it provides both market data backup and news/sentiment in one API, which aligns perfectly with our needs.

### Technical Infrastructure

**3. Database Choice - DECIDED: PostgreSQL**
- **Decision**: PostgreSQL in a Docker container
- **Rationale**: Robust, excellent for time-series data, supports complex queries
- **Implementation**: Docker Compose setup with PostgreSQL 15+

**4. LLM for Sentiment Analysis - DECIDED: OpenAI**
- **Decision**: Use OpenAI GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini
- **Rationale**: State-of-the-art performance, reliable API, cost-effective with mini version
- **Implementation**: OpenAI API integration with fallback between models

### Data Processing Strategy

**5. News Aggregation - DISCUSSION NEEDED**
- **Status**: Requires thorough discussion
- **Key Questions**:
  - How to weight multiple news articles per day?
  - Should we use article publication time vs. market impact time?
  - How to handle conflicting sentiments in the same time window?
- **Proposed Approach**: Weighted average based on article source credibility and recency

**6. Market Hours Alignment - DECIDED: Standard Trading Hours**
- **Decision**: Align sentiment timing with US market hours (EST)
  - SMO (Sentiment at Market Open): 9:30 AM EST
  - SMD (Sentiment Mid-Day): 12:30 PM EST  
  - SMC (Sentiment at Market Close): 4:00 PM EST
- **Implementation**: Time-based filtering of news articles

**7. Competitor Tracking - DECIDED: AMD & NVIDIA**
- **Decision**: Track AMD and NVIDIA as Intel competitors for SDC metric
- **Symbols**: INTC (primary), AMD, NVDA (competitors)
- **Implementation**: Separate sentiment analysis for competitor news

### Project Scope

**8. Data Range - DECIDED: 1 Year Post-2020**
- **Decision**: One year of historical data, any year after 2020
- **Rationale**: Sufficient for initial analysis, recent enough for relevant patterns
- **Implementation**: Select year based on data availability and quality

**9. Symbol Focus - DECIDED: Single Symbol Start**
- **Decision**: Begin with Intel (INTC) only
- **Rationale**: Simplifies initial development and testing
- **Future**: Design architecture to support multiple symbols later

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1A: Data Pipeline Setup
1. Set up PostgreSQL container
2. Implement Yahoo Finance data ingestion (OHLCV)
3. Set up Alpha Vantage news data collection
4. Design database schema for market and news data

### Phase 1B: Calculations & Analysis
1. Implement SMA calculations (1-8 day periods)
2. Implement ROC calculations (1-8 day periods)
3. Set up OpenAI integration for sentiment analysis
4. Develop sentiment scoring pipeline (-1 to +1 scale)

### Phase 1C: Visualization & Analysis Tools
1. Create Jupyter notebook framework
2. Implement data visualization tools
3. Build buy/sell signal analysis tools
4. Develop backtesting framework

## Next Steps
1. Set up development environment
2. Create PostgreSQL Docker container
3. Implement basic data ingestion pipeline
4. Test API integrations (Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, OpenAI)

## Outstanding Questions Requiring Discussion
1. **News Aggregation Strategy**: How to handle multiple news articles per time window?
2. **Sentiment Weighting**: Should we weight news by source reliability or article length?
3. **Market Sector Sentiment (SMS)**: How to define and track "holistic market sector" for semiconductors?
4. **Data Quality Filters**: What criteria should we use to filter low-quality or irrelevant news?
